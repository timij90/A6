      <h1>About This Project</h1>
      <p>
        This website, developed as part of the WEB222 course, features a dynamic and responsive design tailored for
        optimal user experience across a range of devices. It includes a product gallery, an informative about page, and
        a clear honesty policy statement. The primary aim of this project is to showcase proficiency in HTML, CSS, and
        responsive design principles.

        A focal point of the site is the product gallery, which presents a visually attractive and user-friendly
        interface for item display, ensuring easy navigation for visitors. The about page offers deeper insights into
        the purpose and ethos of the website, and the honesty policy underlines our dedication to transparency. More
        than just meeting academic criteria, this project stands as a tangible demonstration of the web development
        competencies acquired during the course.
